This script allows one to<br/> maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general<br/> offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally<br/> provides for 'conffiles'.<br/> .<br/> Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a<br/> file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come<br/> under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at<br/> installation time.

Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses<br/> a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries<br/> to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from<br/> cron.<br/> .<br/> Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation<br/> from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate<br/> are:<br/> .<br/>  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only<br/>    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does<br/>    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for<br/>    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate<br/>    does this as well, but not the original locate.<br/> .<br/>  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time<br/>    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its<br/>    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without<br/>    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding<br/>    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.<br/> .<br/> Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to<br/> mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may<br/> wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,<br/> otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself<br/> (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).<br/> Also, you may wish to remove the \"locate\" package in order not to have<br/> two different database files updated regularly on your system."
